Text Encryption and Decryption Tool-

This Python program provides a simple and interactive way to encrypt and decrypt text using classic cryptographic algorithms. It supports basic encryption methods like the Caesar Cipher and Substitution Cipher. Users can customize their encryption keys for added flexibility.

Features:
Caesar Cipher: Shift letters by a specified number of positions.
Substitution Cipher: Replace each character in the plaintext with a custom-mapped character.
Customizable Keys: Allow users to define their own encryption and decryption keys.
User-Friendly Interface: Input plaintext, keys, and choose the desired algorithm to perform encryption or decryption.
Text Validation: Ensures proper handling of input to avoid errors.

How It Works:
Choose an encryption method (Caesar or Substitution).
Provide the text to encrypt or decrypt.
Input a custom key or use a default one.
Get the result and view the encrypted/decrypted output
